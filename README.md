# Horiseon-Real-World-Challenge-2

Horiseon Webpage Accessibility

    This project is for the Horiseon company website. My task was to diagnose and fix all website accessiblity issues and organize the html code using structure based elements. I have fixed all issues such as making sure all clickable links work and that the website is organized and loads properly. I used vs.code studio along with github pages to ensure everything is in working order. Please review and leave any comments if needed. Thank you.
